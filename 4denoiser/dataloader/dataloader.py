import numpy as np

'''
This module contains all utilities needed to load training data and the live diffraction pattern for denoising into pytorch 

Functions will be added in due course

All assumes that data is held in memory as numpy files currently

If necessary, we could investigate modifying this to holding data as cupy arrays if there is a suitable GPU with enough memory to hold these
